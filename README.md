# What is jwGen? #

jwGen is a Python application designed to convert arbitrary sentences into images. It uses NLTK, the Google Search API, and scikit-image to process the strings, handle image gathering, and facilitate image processing.

This project stems from a collaboration with a Boston-based artist.
